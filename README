*This project is just a practice coding exercise*

A simple web service, which provides analytics of software projects. 
The service parses a property matrix (from CSV) into memory, offers an endpoint that reads a variable name, and provides a list of variables that have a statistical dependency with the variable.
== API == 
 
GET 
  /dependencies
  /dependencies?variable=result_customer_was_happy

The API provides a CSV response like the sample below:

mi,variable
0.2123122,project_tries_new_ways_or_technologies
0.1523122,customer_is_big
0.1523122,people_are_interested
...

The response consists of a list of dependencies sorted by Shannon's mutual information.
